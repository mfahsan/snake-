Description:
The snake game starts at the splash screen and waits for the appropriate key ("S" in this case) to
be pressed to start the game. There are three levels in this game. The game proceeds to the
next level once the timer runs out (30 seconds) or the user presses "2" or "3". The user can
also press "1" to come back to the first level. "P" is used to pause the game, and then "P" to
resume. "Q" is used to quit the game and show the high-score. "R" can be pressed to return to
the splash screen.

Enhancements chosen:
1) Audio. The game outputs a gulp-like sound every time the snake eats an apple.

2) Power up. The star gives the user an extra life. When the user hits the boundary
while having an extra life, the snake just bounces the other way and the extra life
gets used.

Environment:
OS Version: macOS Mojave (10.14.3)
